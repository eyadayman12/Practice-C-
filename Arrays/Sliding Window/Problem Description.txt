/** Given an array and k, find sub array of length k with maximum sum 
 * think in the array: [a b c d e f g h] with k = 3
 * then we want to check
 * [a b c]
 *  [b c d]
 *   [c d e]
 *    [d e f]
 *     [e f g]

 * Enter element number 6 : 6
 * Enter element number 7 : 7
 * Enter element number 8 : 8
 * Enter element number 9 : 9
